Grammar Checker is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python and the PyQt framework. The application leverages the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to perform grammar-checking and text-generation tasks. It provides an interactive interface for users to input text prompts, select language models, and adjust parameters like the maximum number of tokens and temperature.
