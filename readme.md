Grammar Checker is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python and the PyQt framework. The application leverages the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to perform grammar-checking and text-generation tasks. It provides an interactive interface for users to input text prompts, select language models, and adjust parameters like the maximum number of tokens and temperature.

**Usage:**
Clone or download the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Replace API_KEY in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.
Run the app.py script to start the application.
Interact with the GUI to input prompts, select options, and view generated outputs.
